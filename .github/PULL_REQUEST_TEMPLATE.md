### What?

Hello skoreano, I have completed all the requirements as required. I used the form that Nest.js itself uses to structure the folders.

### Why?

I believe it is important because with this pr, I will have the opportunity to educate, even if indirectly, hundreds of people in their most diverse areas ;).

### Any?

Well, as I said above, I basically followed the pattern of Nest.js folders, as they follow closely the structuring of Angular, I ended up applying the same way.
I had problems with both Yup to validate the data and with Joi. It was not the way I would like until I saw that there were annotations that could cover this activity. I also tried to put a middleware to treat the id, but I ended up leaving it as a helper anyway. Anyway, I applied integration tests to the services and created a module just for the middleware, thinking as a system component itself. With its own module. In the end, I really liked the result but I believe there is room for improvement.
